# Anemia Detection and Screening - Machine Learning Project

This repository contains a project on the application of machine learning techniques for the automated screening and detection of anemia using routine hematological data. The project was completed as a final year Bachelor of Science (Computer Science) project report for Savitribai Phule Pune University for the academic year 2024-2025 by Shalom Salve and Jerin Abraham.

### üìä Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the first of its kind for various hematology patients in Iraq and was collected in 2022 from the Medial City / Hematology Center. The dataset contains 300 rows and 28 columns, providing a range of Cell Blood Count (CBC) test features.

**Key features in the dataset include:**
* **Gender**: Patient sex (0 for Female and 1 for Male)
* **WBC**: White Blood Cell count
* **HGB**: Hemoglobin
* **RBC**: Red Blood Cell count
* **MCV**: Mean Corpuscular Volume
* **MCH**: Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin

### üõ†Ô∏è Methodology & Tools

The project follows a supervised learning approach, formulating the anemia detection task as a binary classification problem to categorize patients as 'Anemic' or 'Non-Anemic'.

**Key Tools & Libraries:**
* **Python**: The primary programming language for its versatility and extensive libraries.
* **Google Colab**: A cloud-based interactive environment for executing Python code.
* **Pandas & NumPy**: Used for data manipulation, cleaning, and numerical computations on the hematological data.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Employed for data visualization to explore distributions and relationships between variables, such as correlation heatmaps and pie charts.
* **Scikit-learn**: A machine learning library for data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.
* **XGBoost**: An optimized gradient boosting library used for its high performance and scalability.

**Models Employed:**
* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Decision Tree
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Gaussian Naive Bayes
* Random Forests
* Ensemble Methods (Voting Classifier, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost)

### üìà Findings & Performance

The project demonstrated the strong potential of machine learning, especially boosting algorithms, for automated anemia detection.

The evaluation was conducted using 10-fold cross-validation with accuracy as the primary performance metric. The results showed that:
* **Gradient Boosting** achieved the highest cross-validated accuracy of approximately **99.13%**.
* **AdaBoost** and **XGBoost** followed closely with an accuracy of around **98.70%**.

These findings highlight the feasibility of leveraging machine learning models as valuable tools for the early identification of anemia, which could improve healthcare access and patient outcomes.
